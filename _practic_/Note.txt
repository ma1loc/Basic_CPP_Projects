about:
    Standard Template Library (STL)
    static and non-static in class
    constractor and deconstractor
    const member function
    #pragma once: it prevents duplicate definitions.
    is the constractor and deconstractor method in the class?
    vector with typedef and without?

about the main in account:
{
    - std::vector<int> numbers;
    vector is a class and it's a continer that hold any arry of a fixed type of data
    and is not index based arry access
    and why we use the vector instad of the arry?
        the vector is can be resize rather then the arry it can not.
    vector same as arry but have a dynamic re-size using like "push_back()"
    container’s class has a ::iterator that can give you the access to the continer object member

    - vector methods:
        .at(index)
        .push_back(input)
        summary: vector -> dynamic arry
    - templates:
        everything that takes parameters inside < > is part of a template
        and the inside < > called template argument

    - reference:
        void addApple(const Apple& a);
        If you do const Apple a:
            The function creates a new Apple object (copy) from the one you pass.
            That means memory and time are used to duplicate the object.
            The original object outside the function stays unchanged.
        If you do const Apple &a:
            The function does not create a new object.
            It just uses a reference (alias) to the existing object you already have.
            No copying, faster, and still safe because const prevents changes.

    - constractor:
        is a spacial method in the calss the have same name of the class and no return
        and it runs when the object is created

    - destractor:
        is a method in the class that called in the object destroy from the function
        it creates from, if the function return what is shoude of finish there job.
    - ">>" "<<":
        "<<" → stream insertion (output to a stream)
        ">>" → stream extraction (input from a stream)
}


NOTES TO KNOW:
{
    class test_test
    {
        private:
	        static int test;
    }
    THE PROBLEM: When you only declare static members inside
        a class without defining them elsewhere
        the linker can't find where they're stored in memory
        causing "undefined reference" errors.
    static member in the class -> mean it can call it without create an object
        of the class.
}

exercie to done:
    implement apple with the class      ->  DONE
    implement the iterator with vector  ->  DONE
    implement iterator with digit loop  ->
