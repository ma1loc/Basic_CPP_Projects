TODO: need to know {
	what is Namespace?
		create nested namespaces.
		create namespace inside another one.
	what is a method?
	what is a calss?
	what is streams in cpp?
	what is objects?
	what is instance?
	what is oop?
	#include <iostream>, #include <stdio.h> ?
	Write a newline and flush the stream. (endl)?
	oop, object, class, instance ?
	what is constructor ?
	objects and instances same thing?
	what is stream, ostream?
	what is static/non-static class member?
}

NeedToKnow:
	function overloade (in the Cpp we can have function with same name with diffrent arg number)
		Note: if function with no arg and just a change in the return -> error
	OOP → a way (paradigm) of writing code.
	Object → an instance of a class (created from a class blueprint).
	Class → defines the structure (fields/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions) that its objects will have.
	function -> method
	what is constructor
	get a member into the namespace instad of calling all the namespace
	About the Cpp operator:
		:: -> get access to the members of the namespace
		.	-> get access to the members of the class
	static and non-static:
		to access into one of the member of the class have to make members static.
		ex:
			learning_syntax::Say_hello();

about the phone_book project:
	what is a class?

answers about cpp:
	OOP is just a way to orgnize your program
	In OOP, we create class tha is a blueprint, to create a object
	the blueprint in the class have to main things:
	functions -> called in the class methods
	variables -> called in the class attributes
	An object created from a class is called an instance of that class.

	stream:
		Stream → the concept of ordered data flow.
		pipeline that moves bytes from one place to another
		Buffer → a storage area that helps the stream flow more efficiently.

what's new in C++:
	OOP
	String
	Function Overloading
	Ma1loc -> new
	free -> delete
